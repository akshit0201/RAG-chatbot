How to Run the Boilerplate Chatbot Project:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The project is compatible with Python 3.8 or above.

2. Navigate to the boilerplate_chat_project directory from your terminal.

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies:
   `python3 -m venv chatbot_env`

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   On Windows: `chatbot_env\Scripts\activate`
   On Unix or MacOS: `source chatbot_env/bin/activate`

5. Install the required dependencies by running:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the chatbot application by running:
   `python main.py`

It is assumed that you have or will set up your OpenAI API key in an environment variable named 'OPENAI_API_KEY',
or in a local `.env` file in the same directory as the `main.py` script.

The graphical user interface should now launch in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the chatbot.
